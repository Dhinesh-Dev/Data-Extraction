# Data-Extraction
Here I had created a python program to analyze the images such as bills, To find which image (bill) contains date
# User-Guide
1. Users can specify the entire folder path in basepath variable, which contains the image files. 
2. Because I coded to access entire folder.
3. It is OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Process
4. Users are recommended to run this program on AWS instance. It consumes the program running time. 
5. And the running time is depends on your internet connection speed. 
6. I tested the code using 595 images (bill). Sometimes the aws rekognition couldn't detect the exact characters. 
7. Users Make sure that the all used modules are installed in your python engine, Before run the code.
8. Moreover Here I don't upload the test datasets (images). Users use your own image while running the code.


# Security-Reasons
For some security purpose I don't upload the "credentials.csv" file. Because It contains my aws_access_key and secret_key_id. 
So users are need to credential file to successfully run the code. 

# Thanks
